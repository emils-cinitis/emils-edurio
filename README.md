# Emils Edurio task

## Aspects that were not completed

- No tests for components and their loading;
- No cleanup of code (redundancy checks, etc.) because of lack of time.

## Assumptions

- Using a clean install of Vue3 as by the guidelines stated in Vue3 documentation;
- Expected requirements:
  - CRUD of surveys;
  - Ability to preview survey;
  - Basic design examples;
- Using Bootstrap instead of Vuetify as it's more comfortable for me for the task;
- Using some parts of my own code from other projects to speed up the development (e.g. parts of Input components).

## Other comments

- Task was done in a little bit more that 3 hours;
- Using Node v20.13.1 and NPM v10.5.2;
- Focus was to deliver requried functionality above design as I was more confident in my ability to finish the functionality in a timely manner over creating a better design;
- All views were tested on 1920x1080 view as well as iPhone SE preset (375x667).
